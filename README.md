# Flight Simulation for 3rd Person: Number 03

[Code inspired by this Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphics-with-modern-opengl/)

## Topic

The scene is derived from [scene #2](https://github.com/TallDave67/flight_sim_3p_02).

The code has been re-organized into appropriate sub-folders as the overall size of the project is growing.

An x-wing fighter flies along a closed curve and males smoot turns as it circles a rotating satellite above a spherical (mostly) moon.

Various lights accentuate the drama of the scene.

This scene repeats indefinitely.  So there is plenty of time to explore it by moving the camera using the following keys:

* W or Z: move camera forward (into screen)
* S move camera backwards (out of screen)
* A or Q: move camera left
* D: move camera right

* KEY_UP: angle camera up
* KEY_DOWN: angle camera down
* KEY_LEFT: angle camera left
* KEY_RIGHT: angle camera right
